# Project Hub Development Summary

## Overview

A comprehensive Next.js 15 project management application with multi-workspace support, role-based permissions, and cross-workspace collaboration capabilities.

## Technical Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js 15 with App Router, React 18, TypeScript
- **Authentication**: Clerk (with webhook sync)
- **Database**: Supabase with Drizzle ORM
- **UI Framework**: shadcn-ui components with Tailwind CSS
- **State Management**: TanStack React Query + Jotai
- **Package Manager**: pnpm
- **Notifications**: Sonner
- **Theming**: next-themes (dark/light mode)

## Architecture & Database Schema

### Core Tables

```sql
-- Users (synced from Clerk)
users: id, clerk_id, email, name, avatar_url, created_at, updated_at

-- Workspaces (team/organization containers)
workspaces: id, name, description, created_by, created_at, updated_at

-- User-Workspace Relationships with Roles
user_workspace_roles: user_id, workspace_id, role (OWNER/ADMIN/MEMBER/VIEWER)

-- Projects (within workspaces)
projects: id, workspace_id, name, description, status, priority, tags[], archived, created_by, created_at, updated_at

-- Artifacts (flexible content system)
artifacts: id, project_id, type (TASK/DOC/ASSET/EVENT), title, content (JSONB), created_by, created_at, updated_at
```

### Authentication Flow

1. Clerk handles user authentication
2. Webhook at `/api/webhooks/clerk` syncs user data to Supabase
3. Middleware protects authenticated routes
4. API routes use `const { userId } = await auth()` for authorization

## Development Journey

### Phase 1: Initial Setup & Foundation

- ✅ Created Next.js 15 project with TypeScript
- ✅ Integrated Clerk authentication with webhook sync
- ✅ Set up Supabase database with Drizzle ORM
- ✅ Configured shadcn-ui with Tailwind CSS
- ✅ Implemented dark/light theme switching
- ✅ Built authenticated app layout with sidebar navigation

### Phase 2: Data Layer & API Development

- ✅ Installed TanStack React Query with proper setup
- ✅ Created comprehensive API client utilities
- ✅ Built custom hooks for all CRUD operations:
  - `use-projects`: useProjects, useProject, useCreateProject, useUpdateProject, useDeleteProject, useArchiveProject
  - `use-workspaces`: useWorkspaces, useWorkspace, useCreateWorkspace, useUpdateWorkspace, useDeleteWorkspace
- ✅ Implemented REST API endpoints:
  - **Workspaces**: GET/POST `/api/workspaces`, GET/PATCH/DELETE `/api/workspaces/[workspaceId]`
  - **Projects**: GET/POST `/api/projects`, GET/PATCH/DELETE `/api/projects/[projectId]`
- ✅ Added role-based access control and Zod validation

### Phase 3: Frontend Implementation

- ✅ **Dashboard Page**: Real-time stats, recent projects, workspace-aware display
- ✅ **Projects Page**: Full CRUD interface with creation dialogs, project grid, tags, archive status
- ✅ **Workspaces Page**: Complete workspace management with role indicators
- ✅ Added shadcn components: card, badge, input, label, textarea, dialog, select, dropdown-menu
- ✅ Integrated Sonner for toast notifications

### Phase 4: Workspace State Management

- ✅ Installed Jotai for global state management
- ✅ Created workspace-aware architecture with persistent state:
  - `currentWorkspaceIdAtom`: Tracks selected workspace (localStorage)
  - `currentWorkspaceAtom`: Derived workspace data
  - `switchWorkspaceAtom`: Action atom for workspace switching
- ✅ Built WorkspaceProvider for automatic state synchronization
- ✅ Created WorkspaceSwitcher component in topnav
- ✅ Updated dashboard hierarchy:
  - No workspaces → "Create First Workspace"
  - Has workspaces but no projects → "Create First Project"
  - Has projects → Show stats and recent projects

### Phase 5: Build & Quality Assurance

- ✅ Resolved all linting errors and TypeScript issues
- ✅ Fixed Next.js 15 compatibility (Promise-based route params)
- ✅ Removed server-only import conflicts
- ✅ Ensured proper authentication middleware
- ✅ Verified all CRUD operations work correctly

## API Endpoints

### Workspaces

- `GET /api/workspaces` - List user's workspaces
- `POST /api/workspaces` - Create new workspace
- `GET /api/workspaces/[id]` - Get workspace details
- `PATCH /api/workspaces/[id]` - Update workspace
- `DELETE /api/workspaces/[id]` - Delete workspace

### Projects

- `GET /api/projects` - List projects (workspace-scoped)
- `POST /api/projects` - Create new project
- `GET /api/projects/[id]` - Get project details

## Future Enhancements (Planned)

### Cross-Workspace References

A comprehensive system for workspace and project interconnectivity:

#### Database Extensions

```sql
-- Workspace-to-workspace references
workspace_references: id, source_workspace_id, target_workspace_id, reference_type, created_by, created_at

-- Project-to-project references (cross-workspace)
project_references: id, source_project_id, target_project_id, reference_type, created_by, created_at

-- Cross-workspace permissions
cross_workspace_permissions: id, user_id, workspace_id, granted_by_workspace_id, access_level, created_at
```

#### Reference Types

- **Workspace References**: DEPENDENCY, COLLABORATION, PARENT_CHILD
- **Project References**: DEPENDENCY, BLOCKS, RELATED, SUBTASK

#### Permission Levels

- **READ**: View workspace/project details
- **REFERENCE**: Create references to workspace/projects
- **COLLABORATE**: Participate in cross-workspace activities

#### New Features

- Reference picker with search across accessible workspaces
- Dependency visualization and relationship maps
- Cross-workspace project timelines
- Reference management dashboard
- Notification system for cross-workspace activities

### Additional Planned Features

- Artifact management system (tasks, docs, assets, events)
- Advanced project templates
- Time tracking and reporting
- Team collaboration tools
- Integration with external services
- Mobile-responsive improvements
- Advanced search and filtering
- Export/import capabilities

## Development Guidelines

### Code Standards

- Comments explain **why** code exists, not what it does
- Always use pnpm (not npm) and uv (not pip)
- Fix issues immediately when solution is known
- Write unit tests for Python changes
- Run `make test` and iterate until all tests pass
- Use Tailwind for styling unless CSS modules requested

### Architecture Principles

- Workspace-first design with proper scoping
- Role-based access control throughout
- Optimistic updates with proper error handling
- Type safety with TypeScript
- Consistent API patterns and error responses
- Proper separation of concerns

## Current Status

✅ **Production Ready**: The application is fully functional with:

- Complete authentication and authorization
- Full workspace and project CRUD operations
- Responsive UI with dark/light themes
- Proper error handling and loading states
- Type-safe API layer with React Query
- Persistent workspace context

The foundation is solid and ready for the planned cross-workspace reference system and additional feature development.
